# RDCTP

RDCTP (Resilient Data Collection Tree Problem) refers to the problem to construct an optimized data collection tree in a wireless sensor network. The  
formulation and approximation algorithm are presented in [this paper](https://cred-c.org/sites/default/files/papers/2017_AuthKeyCollect_accepted.pdf).

RDCTP uses [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) to calculate the optimal solution.
